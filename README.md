## General Information
- Predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques such as Ridge and Lasso.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
- The company wants to know: -Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house? -How well those variables describe the price of a house?
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price

## Conclusions
- Regularization is used to make the model simpler. Regularization helps to strike the delicate balance between keeping the model simple and not making it too naive to be of any use. For regression, regularization involves adding a regularization term to the cost that adds up the absolute values or the squares of the parameters of the model. Also, Making a model simple leads to Bias-Variance Trade-off
