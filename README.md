## General Information
- Predicting house prices using advanced regression techniques such as Ridge and Lasso.
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
- The company wants to know: -Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house? -How well those variables describe the price of a house?
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Using Model Selection's GridSearchCV the model arrives at a final optimum lambda to determine the house prices using ridge and lasso regression.
